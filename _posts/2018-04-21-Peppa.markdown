Today is a busy day. I did many somethings.
1. I downloaded some interesting applications, and installed them on my Macbook Pro.
2. I learned some simple English grammar, and hardly tried to use it in the sentences.such as "one/ones","so/such",etc.
3. At the night, I watched Peppa Pig that is a funny cartoon. And I will list some subtitles.
	- Peppa is a wonderful girl and likes to take care of her little brother.
	- It's raining today.So Peppa and George can't play outside.
	- Daddy, It's stopped raining.
	- Can we go out to play?
	- Alright, **run along you two** 
	- Peppa loves jumping in muddy puddles.
	- Peppa, if you jump in muddy puddles, you must wear your boots.
	- Sorry, mummy.s
	- George likes to jump in muddy puddles, too.
